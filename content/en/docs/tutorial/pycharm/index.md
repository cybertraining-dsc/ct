Please ensure that you have a university or college email before proceeding.

1. Open up a web browser and search `pycharm`. Look under the link from `jetbrains.com` and click `Download Pycharm`.

2. Click the blue button that reads `Download` under Professional. Wait for the download to complete.

3. Open the completely downloaded file and click `Yes` on the UAC prompt.
    1. If you have a school computer, please refer to the note under step 5 in the Python tutorial found here:
    https://cybertraining-dsc.github.io/report/su21-reu-361/tutorials/python/
       
4. Click `Next`, click `Next` again, and check the box that reads `Add launchers dir to the PATH`. You can also
create a Desktop Shortcut and create the `.py` association, if you would like. The association changes which program, 
   by default, opens `.py` files on your computer.
   
5. Click `Next` and then click `Install`. Wait for the green progress bar to complete. Then, you must restart your
computer after making sure all of your programs are saved and closed.
   
6. Open PyCharm either by clicking on the Desktop shortcut you might have made, or hit the Windows key and type
`PyCharm` and choose the program from the search results.
   
7. Check the box that says `I confirm that I have read and accept the terms...` after reading through each and every
word and fully committing every character on your screen to memory. Only if you want to!
   
8. Click `Continue`. You can choose to send anonymous statistics, if you want to; click the option you want.

9. Click the hyperlink that says `Buy license` in the top right of the window. Do not worryâ€” you will not be spending
a cent.
   
10. Click the person icon in the top right of the page (if you cannot find this person icon, then click this link
    and hopefully it still works: https://account.jetbrains.com/login).
    
11. Create a JetBrains account by entering your university email address. Click `Sign Up` after entering your email;
then, you have to go on your email and confirm your account in the automated email sent to you. Click `Confirm your
    account` in the email.
    
12. Complete the registration form and click `Submit`.

13. Click `Apply for a free student or teacher license`. Scroll down and click the blue button that reads `Apply now`.

14. Fill out the form, using your university email address and real name. Check the boxes if they apply to you. Then
click `APPLY FOR FREE PRODUCTS`.
    
15. JetBrains should send you an automated email, ideally informing you that your information has been confirmed and
you have been granted a free license. If it does not immediately arrive, wait a few minutes. Go back to PyCharm and
    sign in with your JetBrains account after receiving this email. Click `Activate`. Congratulations!
