Sidenote: An exasperated reader may wonder, "why go through steps 1-3 when it can be as easy as clicking a link to the VSCode download page?" This *would* be easier, but hyperlinks (or URLs) are bound to change through the years of website maintenance and alterations. (One could also argue that steps 1-3 could become incorrect, as well, but hopefully they will not.) If you, time-traveler, would like to try your luck, go here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

If the link works, skip to step 4.

P.S. It should be second-nature to a user to quickly search, find, download, and install a program. It is vital to ensure that the correct program is downloaded and installed, however. Over time, guides like this one can become deprecated, but one must be resilient in problem-solving. Use search engines like Google to find what you are looking for. If one path does not work, take another that will lead to the same destination or a better one.

1. Open up your favorite web browser. This can be done by pressing the Windows key and typing in the name of the browser, like `google chrome` (as long as this browser is already installed on your computer). Then press Enter.

2. Once the browser loads, search for `visual studio code` through the address bar. Press Enter and you will see a list of results through the default search engine (Google, Bing, or whatever is configured on your browser).

3. Identify the result that reads `code.visualstudio.com`. If using Google, a subresult should read `Download`. Click that link.

4. This tutorial assumes that the reader is using Windows. Click the blue link that reads `Windows`. The download will commence; wait for it to finish.

5. Click and open the file once it finishes; the license agreement will appear. If you are proficient in legalese, you can read the wall of text. Then, click `I accept the agreement` and click `Next`.

6. Click `Next` again; it is best to leave the default install path alone for reproducibility in this experiment.

7. Click `Next` again to create a Start Menu folder. Ensure that `Add to PATH` is checked. `Create a desktop icon` can be checked for convenience; it is up to the reader's choice. Then click `Next`.

8. Click Install and watch the green progress bar go at the speed of light. Once completed, click Finish. VSCode will open as long as everything went smoothly.
