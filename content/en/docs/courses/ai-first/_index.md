## Overview
This course is built around the revolution driven by AI and in particular deep learning that is transforming all activities: industry, research, and lifestyle. It will a similar structure to [The Big Data Class](https://cybertraining-dsc.github.io/courses/bigdata2020/)  and the details of the course will be adapted to the interests of participating students. It can include significant deep learning programming.

All activities -- Industry, Research, and Lifestyle  -- are being transformed by Artificial Intelligence AI and Big Data. AI is currently dominated by deep learning implemented on a global pervasive computing environment - the global AI supercomputer. This course studies the technologies and applications of this transformation.

We review Core Technologies driving these transformations: Digital transformation moving to AI Transformation, Big Data, Cloud Computing, software and data engineering, Edge Computing and Internet of Things, The Network and Telecommunications, Apache Big Data Stack, Logistics and company infrastructure, Augmented and Virtual reality, Deep Learning.

There are new “Industries” over the last 25 years: The Internet, Remote collaboration and Social Media, Search, Cybersecurity, Smart homes and cities, Robotics. However, our focus is Traditional “Industries” Transformed: Computing, Transportation: ride-hailing, drones, electric self-driving autos/trucks, road management, travel, construction Industry, Space, Retail stores and e-commerce, Manufacturing: smart machines, digital twins, Agriculture and Food, Hospitality and Living spaces: buying homes, hotels, “room hailing”, Banking and Financial Technology: Insurance, mortgage, payments, stock market, bitcoin, Health: from DL for pathology to personalized genomics to remote surgery, Surveillance and Monitoring: -- Civilian Disaster response; Miltary Command and Control, Energy: Solar wind oil, Science; more data better analyzed; DL as the new applied mathematics, Sports: including Sabermetrics, Entertainment, Gaming including eSports, News, advertising, information creation and dissemination, education, fake news and Politics, Jobs.

We select material from above to match student interests.

Students can take the course in either software-based or report-based mode. The lectures with be offered in video form with a weekly discussion class. Python and Tensorflow will be main software used.

This module covers 51 usecases of Big data that emerged from a NIST
(National Institute for Standards and Technology) study of Big
data. We cover the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG)
Process and summarizes the work of five subgroups: Definitions and
Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture Subgroup, Security and
Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup and the Requirements
andUse Case Subgroup. 51 use cases collected in this process are
briefly discussed with a classification of the source of parallelism
and the high and low level computational structure. We describe the
key features of this classification.

Big Data Applications and Analytics Discovery of Higgs Boson Part I
(Unit 8) Section Units 9-11 Summary: This section starts by describing
the LHC accelerator at CERN and evidence found by the experiments
suggesting existence of a Higgs Boson. The huge number of authors on a
paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman diagrams is followed by an
accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is devoted to Python
experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson production with
various forms of shape of signal and various background and with
various event totals. Then random variables and some simple principles
of statistics are introduced with explanation as to why they are
relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces Gaussian
(normal) distributions and explains why they seen so often in natural
phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random Numbers with
their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial and
Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The
Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.

Sports sees significant growth in analytics with pervasive statistics
shifting to more sophisticated measures. We start with baseball as
game is built around segments dominated by individuals where detailed
(video/image) achievement measures including PITCHf/x and FIELDf/x are
moving field into big data arena. There are interesting relationships
between the economics of sports and big data analytics. We look at
Wearables and consumer sports/recreation. The importance of spatial
visualization is discussed. We look at other Sports: Soccer, Olympics,
NFL Football, Basketball, Tennis and Horse Racing.

### Introduction to Linux

This course does not require you to do much Linux. However, if you do
need it, we recommend the following as starting point listed 

The most
elementary Linux features can be learned in 12 hours. This includes
bash, editor, directory structure, managing files. Under Windows, we
recommend using gitbash, a terminal with all the
commands built-in that you would need for elementary work.

## Contributions

You can contribute to the material with useful links and sections that
you find. Just make sure that you do not plagiarize when making
contributions. Please review our guide on plagiarism.

## Computer Needs

This course does not require a sophisticated computer. Most of the
things can be done remotely. Even a Raspberry Pi with 4 or 8GB could
be used as a terminal to log into remote computers. This will cost you
between $50 - $100 dependent on which version and equipment. However,
we will not teach you how to use or set up a Pi or another
computer in this class. This is for you to do and find out.

In case you need to buy a new computer for school, make sure the
computer is upgradable to 16GB of main memory. We do no longer
recommend using HDD's but use SSDs. Buy the fast ones, as not every
SSD is the same. Samsung is offering some under the EVO Pro
branding. Get as much memory as you can effort. Also, make sure
you back up your work regularly. Either in online storage such as
Google, or an external drive.
