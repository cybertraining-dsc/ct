---
This unit has four lectures (slide=decks). The survey is 6 years old but the illustrative scope of Big Data Applications is still valid and has no better alternative. The problems and use of clouds has not changed. There has been algorithmic advances (deep earning) in some cases. The lectures are

* 1. Overview of NIST Process
* 2. The 51 Use cases divided into groups
* 3. Common features of the 51 Use Cases
* 4. 10 Patterns of data -- computer -- user interaction seen in Big Data Applications

There is an overview of these lectures below. The use case overview slides recorded here are available as [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/104ORUVOwFV23c-GSYvvLWaiVyCXwGDV1Ah5k2kTB4_U/edit?usp=sharing)

## Lecture set 1. Overview of NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Process and Results 

This is first of 4 lectures on Big Data Use Cases. It describes the process by which NIST produced this survey

[Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12F779a9bwsxUaQ66cVZj5AzTpLLdMEUw/view?usp=sharing) or [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BQOuxKU3-y1v6s_nTpSp-3y81EivfanfwlTP-lg_-Tc/edit?usp=sharing)

### Use Case 1-1 Introduction to NIST Big Data Public Working Group

The focus of the (NBD-PWG) is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a consensus definition, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, and technology roadmap. The aim is to create vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic deliverables to enable big data stakeholders to pick-and-choose best analytics tools for their processing and visualization requirements on the most suitable computing platforms and clusters while allowing value-added from big data service providers and flow of data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure manner.

Introduction (13:02)

{{< youtube "3oKdmuH0N3k" >}}

### Use Case 1-2 Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup

The focus is to gain a better understanding of the principles of Big Data. It is important to develop a consensus-based common language and vocabulary terms used in Big Data across stakeholders from industry, academia, and government. In addition, it is also critical to identify essential actors with roles and responsibility, and subdivide them into components and sub-components on how they interact/ relate with each other according to their similarities and differences.
For Definitions: Compile terms used from all stakeholders regarding the meaning of Big Data from various standard bodies, domain applications, and diversified operational environments. For Taxonomies: Identify key actors with their roles and responsibilities from all stakeholders, categorize them into components and subcomponents based on their similarities and differences. In particular data, Science and Big Data terms are discussed.

Taxonomies (7:42)

{{< youtube "7eOtuBV8udo" >}}

### Use Case 1-3 Reference Architecture Subgroup
 
The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a consensus-based approach to orchestrate vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic for analytics tools and computing environments. The goal is to enable Big Data stakeholders to pick-and-choose technology-agnostic analytics tools for processing and visualization in any computing platform and cluster while allowing value-added from Big Data service providers and the flow of the data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure manner. Results include a reference architecture with well-defined components and linkage as well as several exemplars.

Architecture (10:05)

{{< youtube "h4ylW0vztDw" >}}

### Use Case 1-4 Security and Privacy Subgroup

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a consensus secure reference architecture to handle security and privacy issues across all stakeholders. This includes gaining an understanding of what standards are available or under development, as well as identifies which key organizations are working on these standards. The Top Ten Big Data Security and Privacy Challenges from the CSA (Cloud Security Alliance) BDWG are studied. Specialized use cases include Retail/Marketing, Modern Day Consumerism, Nielsen Homescan, Web Traffic Analysis, Healthcare, Health Information Exchange, Genetic Privacy, Pharma Clinical Trial Data Sharing, Cyber-security, Government, Military and Education.

Security (9:51)

{{< youtube "dHrHk-GvruY" >}}

### Use Case 1-5 Technology Roadmap Subgroup


The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a consensus vision with recommendations on how Big Data should move forward by performing a good gap analysis through the materials gathered from all other NBD subgroups. This includes setting standardization and adoption priorities through an understanding of what standards are available or under development as part of the recommendations. Tasks are gathered input from NBD subgroups and study the taxonomies for the actors' roles and responsibility, use cases and requirements, and secure reference architecture; gain an understanding of what standards are available or under development for Big Data; perform a thorough gap analysis and document the findings; identify what possible barriers may delay or prevent the adoption of Big Data; and document vision and recommendations.


Technology (4:14)

{{< youtube "va0UCR5gMTA" >}}

### Use Case 1-6 Requirements and Use Case Subgroup

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a consensus list of Big Data requirements across all stakeholders. This includes gathering and understanding various use cases from diversified application domains.Tasks are gather use case input from all stakeholders; derive Big Data requirements from each use case; analyze/prioritize a list of challenging general requirements that may delay or prevent adoption of Big Data deployment; develop a set of general patterns capturing the *essence* of use cases (not done yet) and work with Reference Architecture to validate requirements and reference architecture by explicitly implementing some patterns based on use cases. The progress of gathering use cases (discussed in next two units) and requirements systemization are discussed.

### Use Case 1-7 Recent Updates of work of NIST Public Big Data Working Group

This video is an update of recent work in this area. The first slide of this short lesson discusses a new version of use case survey that had many improvements including tags to label key features (as discussed in slide deck 3) and merged in a significant set of security and privacy fields.  This came from the security and privacy working group described in lesson 4 of this slide deck. A link for this new use case form is 
https://bigdatawg.nist.gov/_uploadfiles/M0621_v2_7345181325.pdf

A recent December 2018 use case form for Astronomy’s Square Kilometer Array is at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CxqCISK4v9LMMmGox-PG1bLeaRcbAI4cDIlmcoRqbDs/edit?usp=sharing This uses a simplification of the official new form.

## Lecture set 4. The 10 Use Case Patterns from the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG)

[Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rs2h7JTaTbqkZluigD7Wk_22kiaKuZ9s/view?usp=sharing) or [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uD17-CHCFlr05tdmwB8osmIT1vQR-FdDu4A2puNQqs8/edit?usp=sharing)


In this last slide deck of the use cases unit, we will be focusing on 10 Use case patterns. This includes multi-user querying, real-time analytics, batch analytics, data movement from external data sources, interactive analysis, data visualization, ETL, data mining and orchestration of sequential and parallel data transformations. We go through the different ways the user and system interact in each case. The use case patterns are divided into 3 classes 1) initial examples 2) science data use case patterns and 3) remaining use case patterns.
