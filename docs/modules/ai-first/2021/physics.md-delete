## E534 2020 Big Data Applications and Analytics Discovery of Higgs Boson 

Summary: This section of the class is devoted to a particular Physics experiment but uses this to discuss so-called counting experiments. Here one observes “events” that occur randomly in time and one studies the properties of the events; in particular are the events collection of subatomic particles coming from the decay of particles from a “Higgs Boson” produced in high energy accelerator collisions. The four video lecture sets (Parts I II III IV) start by describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and evidence found by the experiments suggesting the existence of a Higgs Boson. The huge number of authors on a paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman diagrams is followed by an accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is devoted to Python experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson production with various forms of the shape of the signal and various backgrounds and with various event totals. Then random variables and some simple principles of statistics are introduced with an explanation as to why they are relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces Gaussian (normal) distributions and explains why they have seen so often in natural phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random Numbers with their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial and Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The Central Limit Theorem concludes the discussion.

### Looking for Higgs Particle and Counting Introduction 1

We return to the particle case with slides used in introduction and stress that particles often manifested as bumps in histograms and those bumps need to be large enough to stand out from the background in a statistically significant fashion.

We describe the DIKW pipeline for the analysis of this type of physics experiment and go through details of the analysis pipeline for the LHC ATLAS experiment. We give examples of event displays showing the final state particles seen in a few events. We illustrate how physicists decide what’s going on with a plot of expected Higgs production experimental cross sections (probabilities) for signal and background.

### Homework 3 (Posted on [Canvas](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1908830/assignments/11210806))

The use case analysis that you were asked to watch in week 3, described over 50 use cases based on templates filled in by users.  This homework has two choices.

1. Consider the existing SKA Template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZMrga5R_idBcFlhvvhlcOP9aX--bpqhJg4XSS3Qi3ws/edit?usp=sharing). Use this plus web resources such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/user/SquareKilometreArray) to write a 3 page description of science goals, current progress and big data challenges of the SKA

OR

2. Here is a Blank use case [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pEiOjHuVYgu2sCjJ1A-GzVabYnkQn7eQ0BfUNJwrgMc/edit?usp=sharing) (make your own copy). Chose any Big Data use case (including those in videos but address 2020 not 2013 situation) and fill in ONE new use case template producing about 2 pages of new material (summed over answers to questions)

### Homwork 4 (Posted on [Canvas](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1908830/assignments/11232343))

Consider Physics Colab A **"Part 4 Error Estimates" and Colab D "Part 2 Varying Seed (randomly) gives distinct results"**

Consider a Higgs of measured width 0.5 GeV (narrowGauss and narrowTotal in Part A) and use analysis of A Part 4 to estimate the difference between signal and background compared to expected error (standard deviation)

Run 3 different random number choices (as in D Part 2) to show how conclusions change

Recommend changing bin size in A Part 4 from 2 GeV to 1 GeV when the Higgs signal will be in two bins you can add (equivalently use 2 GeV histogram bins shifting origin so Higgs mass of 126 GeV is in the center of a bin)

Suppose you keep background unchanged and reduce the Higgs signal by a factor of 2 (300 to 150 events). Can Higgs still be detected?
